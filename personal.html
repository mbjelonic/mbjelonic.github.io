<p style="text-align:justify">
I was born in 1990 in Yugoslavia, right before the start of the civil war.
When the war began, my parents and I managed to escape the country and we
found a new home in Germany where my talented younger brother Filip was born.
This constant fight for asylum shaped the first years of my life, gifted me a
relentless determination, and gave me a deep appreciation for the sacrifice of
my parents. After more than ten years in Germany, we managed to receive a
permanent residency, and in 2018 I proudly received my German passport. I
continue to dedicate my work and achievements to my family, Ostoja, Snijezana,
and Filip.

<p style="text-align:justify">
Today I am happy to call Switzerland my home, but this has not stopped me from
<a href=#Visited_Countries>traveling the globe</a>, eager to understand the perspectives of others, and
especially what motivates them. Spending my time in robotics has the potential
to create a silo kind of thinking, and so in my reading, I have tried to
venture into disciplines that might augment my knowledge and potentially help
me understand the world from different points of view. Perhaps you will enjoy
my <a href=#Book_Recommendations>book recommendations</a> below, and like me, they will take you on an
intellectual journey to places you had not considered before.

      <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman>Daniel Kahneman</a>
      is probably the most influential writer in my reading list since his book is cited by most of the other
      authors presented here. He speaks about the fast thinking <i>system one</i> and the slow thinking counterpart
      called <i>system two</i>. As humans, our decisions in life are influenced continuously by heuristics and biases,
      e.g., anchoring, availability heuristic, attribute substitution, optimism and loss aversion, framing effect,
      and sunk-cost fallacy.
      Overcoming these pitfalls might enable us to think more rationally and in a more statistical way. It is the first time
      that I read about the expert problem and the overconfidence in decision-making that comes with it. As if that were not enough,
      we are our <i>remembering selves</i>, and the <i>experiencing selves</i>, who make our living, are like strangers to us. I
      highly recommend reading this book especially if all the concepts are new to you.
      The book taught me a lot about my own mistakes when it comes to decision making.
      More importantly, I can see some of the same behaviours in the people around me.
      Mastering these concepts enables me to understand and influence others in a better way.
      For example, knowing that humans give a stronger weighting to peak experiences and how an experience ends,
      lets me structure my encounter with other people more effectively. You can find
      a <a href=https://youtu.be/XgRlrBl-7Yg>TED talk</a> and a <a href=https://youtu.be/CjVQJdIrDJ0>Google talk</a>
      of Daniel presenting his research. By the way, he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences!

      The world is becoming a better place, and
      <a href=https://stevenpinker.com/>Steven Pinker</a> is giving proof to the world's enlightenment with data.
      The fact is that the news is becoming more and more negative. Our progress in all areas like health,
      prosperity, safety, peace, and happiness, however, has tended to rise worldwide. He explains the cognitive
      science of why this progress should be appreciated. To be honest, before I read the book, I had no idea about
      the development in the last centuries, and I was also influenced by the media. Knowing about what we as humans
      have achieved makes me confident that we will be able to solve possible future problems that artificial
      intelligence, automation, nuclear weapons and environmental pollution will bring to us. The
      <a href=https://youtu.be/Sm5xF-UYgdg>TED talk of Hans and Ola Riesling</a> shows how

      This book has a special meaning for me since my <a href=https://www.breathworkzurich.com/>girlfriend</a> gave it to me as a present at the beginning of our relationship.
      <a href=https://www.solveforhappy.com/>Mo Gawdat</a> is the former Chief Business Officer at Google's [X].
      He realized that despite his incredible
      success, he was desperately unhappy. After the sudden death of his son, he decided to write this book.
      Mo's book provides a path to happiness by following a predictable equation.
      Happiness is bigger or equal than your perception of the events of your
      life subtracted by your expectations of how life should be,
      i.e., Happiness &#8805; Events - Expectations.
      The five key lessons of his book are:
      1) Happiness isn’t something you find – it’s something you work on;
      2) Accept that life won’t always go your way
      3) In this moment, there is absolutely nothing wrong at all;
      4) Life is mostly made up of positives; and
      5) You are in charge of what you choose to focus on.
      Being in a highly competitive environment that is shaped by high external expectations,
      it becomes difficult to find happiness and fulfillment. My personal takeaway from the book is to
      give myself each day time to sit and think. We are living in a world where we are always overwhelmed
      by the constant flow of information and impressions. Investing time in yourself is my number one tip for success.
      Mo's <a href=https://youtu.be/AT9lD8TGyiM>Google talk</a> gives you a glimpse of how to engineer your path to joy.

		<p style="text-align:justify">
      <a href=https://www.ynharari.com/>Yuval Noah Harari</a> takes us on an
      impressive view through the history of humankind. He
      divides our history into four major parts given by the  Cognitive
      Revolution (c. 70,000 BCE), the Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BCE),
      the Unification of Humankind, and the Scientific Revolution (c. 1500 CE).
      The ability of humans to cooperate in large groups is Yuval's main
      explanation for our domination of the world. To this end, our unique ability to
      believe in fictional stories existing purely in the imagination enables us to
      function in larger numbers. Our imaginations might arise from gods,
      nations, money, human rights, or quite controversely corporations like
      Google. To my surprise, all these beliefs are only man-made and became
      only possible through technological progress. For example, the rise of capitalism and
      democracy is thanks to the development of
      infrastructure and the large-scale information exchange. Future technologies like
      artificial intelligence might create new social structures that are not
      thinkable today, and today's beliefs in concepts like individualism might
      become deprecated. He claims that the progress throughout history did not
      necessarily create a better and happier society, which is, for me, quite controversial.
      On the contrary, <a href=#Enlightenment_Now>Steven Pinker's book</a>
      proves with data that the world is becoming a better place. You can find an interesting
      conversation between Yuval and Steven <a href=https://youtu.be/qHSzeijQ95I>here</a>.
      Yuval's conclusion considers how modern technology may soon end our species.

      ... building upon the predecessor, <a href=#Enlightenment_Now>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a>,
      Yuval reviews the current abilities and achievements of humankind.
      The book attempts to paint an image of the future. As already mentioned
      in my previous book review of his predecessor, beliefs in the human experience,
      individualism, human emotion, and consciousness are being threatened by scientific advancements.
      To this end, our society is on the way to gain happiness, immortality,
      and God-like powers. The book closes with the following question:
      "What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious
      but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"
      Yuval's tone seems to be quite cynical when it comes to our future, and
      in certain parts, he sounds apocalyptic. Personally, I am more positive
      than him regarding human's future and our technological advancements.
      The topics that he raises, however, are essential and need to be publicly
      addressed. But as usual, our political leaders are busy trying to solve our
      present problems. For somebody like me, who is trying to shape the future of
      the world, this book reminds me of my ethical responsibilities as a researcher.

      <a href=https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>
      is of Lebanese descent but worked in New York as an option trader and
      quantitative analyst. The Black Swan theory is about the extreme impact
      of rare and unpredictable events. Humans tend to find simplistic
      explanations for these events retrospectively. One of my favorite examples
      is his quote from Stalin, who said: "One death is a tragedy; a million is
      a statistic." The quotation summarizes how news can cause outrages about
      rare events like terrorism, which makes us overestimate the likelihood of a
      potential terrorist attack.
      On the other hand, car accidents and diabetes are killing far more US
      Americans than terrorism. Still, we hear nothing from these events in the news.
      We live in an <i>Extremistan</i> world where we are subjected to Black Swans, i.e.,
      a society where the total can be conceivably impacted by a single observation.
      In this respect, we are fooled by randomness, and many financial institutions
      use Gaussian distributions, i.e., the bell-curve, to mitigate risk. One
      famous example is the bankruptcy of a hedge fund called Long-Term Capital
      Management (LTCM) in 1998. The investment company used the risk expertise
      of two Nobel economists, who were called geniuses but were, in fact, using
      phony, bell-curve-style mathematics. That is all well and good, but how
      should we deal with Black Swans? The central idea is not to attempt to
      predict Black Swan events but to build robustness to negative events and
      an ability to exploit positive events. Methods like the barbell strategy
      consist of taking both a defensive attitude and an excessively aggressive
      one at the same time. For example, I am putting around 80% of my money in
      the safest instruments available (mostly boring index funds) and the
      remaining 20% on extremely speculative bets. You can check out his
      <a href=https://youtu.be/S3REdLZ8Xis>Google talk</a> to find out more
      about his book, but I highly recommend reading it!

      <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brockman_(literary_agent)>John Brockman</a>
      is a passionate advocate of cutting edge ideas of both science and the arts.
      Moreover, he founded the
      <a href=https://www.edge.org/>Edge Foundation</a>,
      an organization aimed to bring together
      the world's finest minds. Similarly, this book is a collection of 205 of the world's
      most influential thinkers from all disciplines, e.g., physicists, economists,
      psychologists, philosophers, novelists, artists, and more. Many scientific concepts
      changed my way of how I perceive the universe and my everyday life.
      Besides, some of the ideas encouraged me to further research the topic at my own.
      It is is impossible for me to summarize the book here. Therefore, I am introducing
      one of my favorite ideas of the book — the concept of entropy picked up by
      <a href=https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/SLLOYD@MIT.EDU>Seth Lloyd</a>,
      <a href=https://stevenpinker.com/>Steven Pinker</a>,
      <a href=https://sifter.org/~aglisi/>Antony Garrett Lisi</a> and
      <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Ulrich_Obrist>Hans Ulrich Obrist</a>.
      The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system entropy never
      decreases. Isolated systems inherently become "less structured, less organized,
      less able to accomplish interesting and useful outcomes." Only by adding
      external energy the closed system can decrease its entropy, i.e., become more
      structured. This law is far more than just the foundation of our universe. Our
      understanding of our everyday life should take into account that any system
      becomes more unorganized over time. An underappreciation of the second law of
      thermodynamics lures people into seeing every unsolved social problem as a sign
      that their country is being guided poorly. "It is in the nature of the universe
      that life has problems." We need to apply constantly information and energy to
      expand our order or, as Erwin Schroedinger's "What is life?" teaches us that
      order comes from disorder.
