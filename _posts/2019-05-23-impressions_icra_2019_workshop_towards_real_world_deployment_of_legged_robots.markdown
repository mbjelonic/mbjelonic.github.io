Full day workshop "Towards Real-World Deployment of Legged Robots" at ICRA 2019 (May 23/24, 2019) in Montreal, Canada.
</p>

The workshop was a huge success for us and I was proud to be one of the main organizers
of this event. We managed to gather an exciting group of speakers and real robots.
For more information you can visit the website below and I also included some
impressions from the workshop here.
