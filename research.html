We show dynamic locomotion strategies for wheeled quadrupedal robots which 
combine the advantages of walking and driving. The developed optimization
framework tightly integrates the additional degrees of freedom introduced by
the wheels. Our approach relies on a zero-moment point based motion optimization
which continuously updates reference trajectories. The reference motions are
tracked by a hierarchical whole-body controller which optimizes the generalized
accelerations and contact forces by solving a sequence of prioritized tasks
including the nonholonomic rolling constraints. Our approach has been tested on
the torque-controlled robot ANYmal equipped with non-steerable,
torque-controlled wheels. We conducted experiments on flat, inclined and rough
terrain, whereby we show that integrating the wheels into the motion control
and planning framework results in intuitive motion trajectories, which enable
more robust and dynamic locomotion compared to other wheeled-legged robots.
Moreover, with a speed of 4 m/s and a reduction of the cost of transport
by 83 % we prove the superiority of wheeled-legged robots compared to their
legged counterparts.

We present a trajectory optimizer for quadrupedal
robots with actuated wheels. By solving for angular, vertical, and
planar components of the base and feet trajectories in a cascaded
fashion and by introducing a novel linear formulation of the zero-
moment point (ZMP) balance criterion, we rely on quadratic
programming only, thereby eliminating the need for nonlinear
optimization routines. Yet, even for gaits containing full flight
phases, we are able to generate trajectories for executing complex
motions that involve simultaneous driving, walking, and turning.
We verified our approach in simulations of the quadrupedal
robot ANYmal equipped with wheels, where we are able to run
the proposed trajectory optimizer at 50 Hz. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that such dynamic motions are
demonstrated for wheeled-legged quadrupedal robots using an
online motion planner.

Traditional legged robots are capable of traversing challenging terrain, but
lack of energy efficiency when compared to wheeled systems operating on flat
environments. The combination of both locomotion domains overcomes the trade-off
between mobility and efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents a novel motion
planner and controller which together enable a legged robot equipped with skates
to perform skating maneuvers. These are achieved by an appropriate combination
of planned reaction forces and gliding motions. Our novel motion controller
formulates a Virtual Model Controller and an optimal contact force distribution
which takes into account the nonholonomic constraints introduced by the skates.
This approach has been tested on the torque-controllable robot ANYmal equipped
with passive wheels and ice skates as end-effectors. We conducted experiments
on flat and inclined terrain, whereby we show that skating motions reduces the
cost of transport by up to 80 % with respect to traditional walking gaits.

Legged robots are an efficient alternative for navigation in challenging
terrain. In this paper we describe Weaver, a six‐legged robot that is designed
to perform autonomous navigation in unstructured terrain. It uses stereo vision
and proprioceptive sensing based terrain perception for adaptive control while
using visual‐inertial odometry for autonomous waypoint‐based navigation.
Terrain perception generates a minimal representation of the traversed
environment in terms of roughness and step height. This reduces the complexity
of the terrain model significantly, enabling the robot to feed back information
about the environment into its controller. Furthermore, we combine exteroceptive
and proprioceptive sensing to enhance the terrain perception capabilities,
especially in situations in which the stereo camera is not able to generate an
accurate representation of the environment. The adaptation approach described
also exploits the unique properties of legged robots by adapting the virtual
stiffness, stride frequency, and stride height. Weaver's unique leg design with
five joints per leg improves locomotion on high gradient slopes, and this novel
configuration is further analyzed. Using these approaches, we present an
experimental evaluation of this fully self‐contained hexapod performing
autonomous navigation on a multiterrain testbed and in outdoor terrain.
