  abstract  = {The ability to traverse uneven terrain is one of the key
               advantages of legged robots. However, their effectiveness relies
               on selecting appropriate gait parameters, such as stride height
               and leg stiffness. The optimal parameters highly depend on the
               characteristics of the terrain. This work presents a novel stereo
               vision based terrain sensing method for a hexapod robot with 30
               degrees of freedom. The terrain in front of the robot is analyzed
               by extracting a set of features which enable the system to
               characterize a large number of terrain types. Gait parameters and
               leg stiffness for impedance control are adapted based on this
               terrain characterization. Experiments show that adaptive
               impedance control leads to efficient locomotion in terms of
               energy consumption, mission success and body stability.},

  abstract  = {Legged robots such as hexapods have the potential to traverse
              unstructured terrain. This paper introduces a novel hexapod robot
              (Weaver) using a hierarchical controller, with the ability to
              efficiently traverse uneven and inclined terrain. The robot has
              five joints per leg and 30 degrees of freedom overall. The two
              redundant joints improve the locomotion of the robot by
              controlling the body pose and the leg orientation with respect to
              the ground. The impedance controller in Cartesian space reacts to
              unstructured terrain and thus achieves self-stabilizing behavior
              without prior profiling of the terrain through exteroceptive
              sensing. Instead of adding force sensors, the force at the foot
              tip is calculated by processing the current signals of the
              actuators. This work experimentally evaluates Weaver with the
              proposed controller and demonstrates that it can effectively
              traverse challenging terrains and high gradient slopes, reduce
              angular movements of the body by more than 55{\%} and reduce the cost
              of transport (up to 50{\%} on uneven terrain and by 85% on a slope
              with 20 °). The controller also enables Weaver to walk up
              inclines of up to 30 °, and remain statically stable on inclines
              up to 50 °. Furthermore, we present a new metric for legged robot
              stability performance along with a method for proprioceptive

              mass. MAX is 2.25 m tall at full height and has a mass of
              approximately 60 kg, which makes it 5 to 20 times lighter than

               hexapod platform (Weaver), making it capable of autonomously
               navigating in uneven terrain. The main contribution stems from
               the use of vision-based exteroceptive terrain perception to adapt
               the robot's locomotion parameters. Avoiding computationally
               expensive path planning for the individual foot tips, the
               adaptation controller enables the robot to reactively adapt to
               the surface structure it is moving on. The virtual stiffness,
               which mainly characterizes the behavior of the legs' impedance
               controller is adapted according to visually perceived terrain
               properties. To further improve locomotion, the frequency and
               height of the robot's stride are similarly adapted. Furthermore,
               novel methods for terrain characterization and a keyframe based
               visual-inertial odometry algorithm are combined to generate a
               spatial map of terrain characteristics. Localization via odometry
               also allows for autonomous missions on variable terrain by
               incorporating global navigation and terrain adaptation into one
               control architecture. Autonomous runs on a testbed with variable
               terrain types illustrate that adaptive stride and impedance
               behavior decreases the cost of transport by 30 {\%} compared to a
               non-adaptive approach and simultaneously increases body stability
               (up to 88 {\%} on even terrain and by 54 {\%} on uneven terrain).
               Weaver is able to freely explore outdoor environments as it is
               completely free of external tethers, as shown in the
               experiments.},

               maintenance and user-friendly handling, while focusing on high

               sealed to reach IP67 standard and protected to survive falls.
               Rotating lidar sensors in the front and back are used for
               localization and terrain mapping and compact force sensors in the
               feet provide accurate measurements about the contact situations.
               The variable payload, such as a modular pan-tilt head with a
               variety of inspection sensors, can be exchanged depending on the
               application. Thanks to novel, compliant joint modules with
               integrated electronics, ANYmal is precisely torque controllable

               six‐legged robot that is designed to perform autonomous
               navigation in unstructured terrain. It uses stereo vision and
               proprioceptive sensing based terrain perception for adaptive
               control while using visual‐inertial odometry for autonomous
               waypoint‐based navigation. Terrain perception generates a minimal
               representation of the traversed environment in terms of roughness
               and step height. This reduces the complexity of the terrain
               model significantly, enabling the robot to feed back information
               about the environment into its controller. Furthermore, we
               combine exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensing to enhance the
               terrain perception capabilities, especially in situations in
               which the stereo camera is not able to generate an accurate

               systems operating on flat environments. The combination of both
               locomotion domains overcomes the trade-off between mobility and

               severely limit off-field landing possibilities, which are crucial
               when operating in scenarios such as mountain rescue. In this
               context, slopes beyond 8 ◦ and small obstacles can already pose a
               substantial hazard. An adaptive landing gear is proposed to
               overcome these limitations. It consists of four legs with one
               degree of freedom each. The total weight was minimized to
               demonstrate economic practicability. This was achieved by an
               innovative actuation, composed of a parallel arrangement of motor
               and brake, which relieves the motor from large impact loads
               during hard landings. The loads are alleviated by a spring-damper
               system acting in series to the actuation. Each leg is
               individually force controlled for optimal load distribution on
               compliant ground and to avoid tipping. The operation of the legs
               is fully autonomous during the landing phase. A prototype was
               designed and successfully tested on an unmanned helicopter with a
               maximum take-off weight of 78 kg. Finally, the implementation of
               the landing gear concept on aircraft of various scales was
               discussed.},

               such as inspection and payload delivery. In the ARGOS

               localize on the industrial site and map the terrain and obstacles
               around the robot. In the ERL competition, additional Real-Time

               co-localize the legged robot with respect to a Micro Aerial

               Footholds and swing trajectories are computed based on the terrain, and the robot body pose is optimized

               online on a real robot and generate trajectories several meters long. We first tested our algorithm in
               several simulations with varied confined spaces using the quadrupedal robot ANYmal. We also simulated
               experiments with the hexapod robot Weaver to demonstrate applicability to different legged robot
               configurations. Then, we demonstrated our whole body planner in several online experiments both indoors
               and in realistic scenarios at an emergency rescue training facility. ANYmal, which has a nominal
               standing height of 80 cm and width of 59 cm, navigated through several representative disaster areas
               with openings as small as 60 cm. 3 m trajectories were re-planned with 500 ms update times.},

               potential to traverse challenging terrain. To exploit the full
               potential, it is crucial to tightly integrate terrain
               perception for foothold planning. We present a hierarchical
               locomotion planner together with a foothold optimizer that
               finds locally optimal footholds within an elevation map. The
               map is generated in real-time from on-board depth sensors. We
               further propose a terrain-aware contact schedule to deal with
               actuator velocity limits. We validate the combined locomotion
               pipeline on our quadrupedal robot ANYmal with a variety of
               simulated and real-world experiments. We show that our method
               can cope with stairs and obstacles of heights up to 33% of the

  abstract  = {The additional degrees of freedom and missing counterparts in
               nature make designing locomotion capabilities for wheeled-legged
               robots more challenging. We propose a whole-body model
               predictive controller as a single task formulation that
               simultaneously optimizes wheel and torso motions. Due to the
               real-time joint velocity and ground reaction force optimization
               based on a kinodynamic model, our approach accurately captures
               the real robot's dynamics and automatically discovers complex
               and dynamic motions cumbersome to hand-craft through heuristics.
               Thanks to the single set of parameters for all behaviors,
               whole-body optimization makes online gait sequence adaptation
               possible. Aperiodic gait sequences are automatically found
               through kinematic leg utilities without the need for predefined
               contact and lift-off timings. Also, this enables us to reduce
               the cost of transport of wheeled-legged robots significantly.
               Our experiments demonstrate highly dynamic motions on a
               quadrupedal robot with non-steerable wheels in challenging
               indoor and outdoor environments. Herewith, we verify that a
               single task formulation is key to reveal the full potential of
               wheeled-legged robots.},

               the system dynamics, friction constraints, and kinematic limitations.
               A relaxed barrier function is added to the optimization's cost function,
               leading to collision avoidance behavior without increasing the problem's
               computational complexity. Our holistic approach does not require any
               heuristics and enables legged robots to find whole-body motions in the
               presence of static and dynamic obstacles. We use a dynamically generated
               euclidean signed distance field for static collision checking. Collision
               checking for dynamic obstacles is modeled with moving cylinders, increasing
               the responsiveness to fast-moving agents. Furthermore, we include a Kalman
               filter motion prediction for moving obstacles into our receding horizon
               planning, enabling the robot to anticipate possible future collisions. Our
               experiments demonstrate collision-free motions on a quadrupedal robot in
               challenging indoor environments. The robot handles complex scenes like
               overhanging obstacles and dynamic agents by exploring motions at the robot's

  title     = {CERBERUS: Autonomous Legged and Aerial Robotic Exploration in the Tunnel and Urban Circuits of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge},
  journal   = {Journal of Field Robotics},
  year      = {2021},
  abstract  = {Autonomous exploration of subterranean environments constitutes a
               major frontier for robotic systems as underground settings present key
               challenges that can render robot autonomy hard to achieve. This has
               motivated the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, where teams of robots search
               for objects of interest in various underground environments. In response,
               the CERBERUS system-of-systems is presented as a unified strategy towards
               subterranean exploration using legged and flying robots.  As primary robots,
               ANYmal quadruped systems are deployed considering their endurance and potential
               to traverse challenging terrain. For aerial robots, both conventional and
               collision-tolerant multirotors are utilized to explore spaces too narrow or
               otherwise unreachable by ground systems. Anticipating degraded sensing
               conditions, a complementary multi-modal sensor fusion approach utilizing
               camera, LiDAR, and inertial data for resilient robot pose estimation is
               proposed. Individual robot pose estimates are refined by a centralized
               multi-robot map optimization approach to improve the reported location
               accuracy of detected objects of interest in the DARPA-defined coordinate
               frame. Furthermore, a unified exploration path planning policy is presented
               to facilitate the autonomous operation of both legged and aerial robots in
               complex underground networks. Finally, to enable communication between the
               robots and the base station, CERBERUS utilizes a ground rover with a high-gain 
               antenna and an optical fiber connection to the base station, alongside breadcrumbing
               of wireless nodes by our legged robots. We report results from the CERBERUS
               system-of-systems deployment at the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Tunnel and Urban Circuits,
               along with the current limitations and the lessons learned for the benefit of the community.},
