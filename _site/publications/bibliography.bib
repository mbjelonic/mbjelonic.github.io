  abstract  = {The ability to traverse uneven terrain is one of the key
               advantages of legged robots. However, their effectiveness relies
               on selecting appropriate gait parameters, such as stride height
               and leg stiffness. The optimal parameters highly depend on the
               characteristics of the terrain. This work presents a novel stereo
               vision based terrain sensing method for a hexapod robot with 30
               degrees of freedom. The terrain in front of the robot is analyzed
               by extracting a set of features which enable the system to
               characterize a large number of terrain types. Gait parameters and
               leg stiffness for impedance control are adapted based on this
               terrain characterization. Experiments show that adaptive
               impedance control leads to efficient locomotion in terms of
               energy consumption, mission success and body stability.},
