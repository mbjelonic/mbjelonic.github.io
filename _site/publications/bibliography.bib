  abstract  = {The ability to traverse uneven terrain is one of the key
               advantages of legged robots. However, their effectiveness relies
               on selecting appropriate gait parameters, such as stride height
               and leg stiffness. The optimal parameters highly depend on the
               characteristics of the terrain. This work presents a novel stereo
               vision based terrain sensing method for a hexapod robot with 30
               degrees of freedom. The terrain in front of the robot is analyzed
               by extracting a set of features which enable the system to
               characterize a large number of terrain types. Gait parameters and
               leg stiffness for impedance control are adapted based on this
               terrain characterization. Experiments show that adaptive
               impedance control leads to efficient locomotion in terms of
               energy consumption, mission success and body stability.},

  abstract  = {Legged robots such as hexapods have the potential to traverse
              unstructured terrain. This paper introduces a novel hexapod robot
              (Weaver) using a hierarchical controller, with the ability to
              efficiently traverse uneven and inclined terrain. The robot has
              five joints per leg and 30 degrees of freedom overall. The two
              redundant joints improve the locomotion of the robot by
              controlling the body pose and the leg orientation with respect to
              the ground. The impedance controller in Cartesian space reacts to
              unstructured terrain and thus achieves self-stabilizing behavior
              without prior profiling of the terrain through exteroceptive
              sensing. Instead of adding force sensors, the force at the foot
              tip is calculated by processing the current signals of the
              actuators. This work experimentally evaluates Weaver with the
              proposed controller and demonstrates that it can effectively
              traverse challenging terrains and high gradient slopes, reduce
              angular movements of the body by more than 55{\%} and reduce the cost
              of transport (up to 50{\%} on uneven terrain and by 85% on a slope
              with 20 °). The controller also enables Weaver to walk up
              inclines of up to 30 °, and remain statically stable on inclines
              up to 50 °. Furthermore, we present a new metric for legged robot
              stability performance along with a method for proprioceptive

               hexapod platform (Weaver), making it capable of autonomously
               navigating in uneven terrain. The main contribution stems from
               the use of vision-based exteroceptive terrain perception to adapt
               the robot's locomotion parameters. Avoiding computationally
               expensive path planning for the individual foot tips, the
               adaptation controller enables the robot to reactively adapt to
               the surface structure it is moving on. The virtual stiffness,
               which mainly characterizes the behavior of the legs' impedance
               controller is adapted according to visually perceived terrain
               properties. To further improve locomotion, the frequency and
               height of the robot's stride are similarly adapted. Furthermore,
               novel methods for terrain characterization and a keyframe based
               visual-inertial odometry algorithm are combined to generate a
               spatial map of terrain characteristics. Localization via odometry
               also allows for autonomous missions on variable terrain by
               incorporating global navigation and terrain adaptation into one
               control architecture. Autonomous runs on a testbed with variable
               terrain types illustrate that adaptive stride and impedance
               behavior decreases the cost of transport by 30 {\%} compared to a
               non-adaptive approach and simultaneously increases body stability
               (up to 88 {\%} on even terrain and by 54 {\%} on uneven terrain).
               Weaver is able to freely explore outdoor environments as it is
               completely free of external tethers, as shown in the
               experiments.},

               maintenance and user-friendly handling, while focusing on high

               sealed to reach IP67 standard and protected to survive falls.
               Rotating lidar sensors in the front and back are used for
               localization and terrain mapping and compact force sensors in the
               feet provide accurate measurements about the contact situations.
               The variable payload, such as a modular pan-tilt head with a
               variety of inspection sensors, can be exchanged depending on the
               application. Thanks to novel, compliant joint modules with
               integrated electronics, ANYmal is precisely torque controllable

               six‐legged robot that is designed to perform autonomous
               navigation in unstructured terrain. It uses stereo vision and
               proprioceptive sensing based terrain perception for adaptive
               control while using visual‐inertial odometry for autonomous
               waypoint‐based navigation. Terrain perception generates a minimal
               representation of the traversed environment in terms of roughness
               and step height. This reduces the complexity of the terrain
               model significantly, enabling the robot to feed back information
               about the environment into its controller. Furthermore, we
               combine exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensing to enhance the
               terrain perception capabilities, especially in situations in
               which the stereo camera is not able to generate an accurate

               systems operating on flat environments. The combination of both
               locomotion domains overcomes the trade-off between mobility and

  abstract  = {Conventional skid or wheel based helicopter landing gears
               severely limit off-field landing possibilities, which are crucial
               when operating in scenarios such as mountain rescue. In this
               context, slopes beyond 8 ◦ and small obstacles can already pose a
               substantial hazard. An adaptive landing gear is proposed to
               overcome these limitations. It consists of four legs with one
               degree of freedom each. The total weight was minimized to
               demonstrate economic practicability. This was achieved by an
               innovative actuation, composed of a parallel arrangement of motor
               and brake, which relieves the motor from large impact loads
               during hard landings. The loads are alleviated by a spring-damper
               system acting in series to the actuation. Each leg is
               individually force controlled for optimal load distribution on
               compliant ground and to avoid tipping. The operation of the legs
               is fully autonomous during the landing phase. A prototype was
               designed and successfully tested on an unmanned helicopter with a
               maximum take-off weight of 78 kg. Finally, the implementation of
               the landing gear concept on aircraft of various scales was
               discussed.},

               navigate in real-world scenarios to complete high-level tasks
               such as inspection and payload delivery. In the ARGOS

               localize on the industrial site and map the terrain and obstacles
               around the robot. In the ERL competition, additional Real-Time
               Kinematic (RTK)-Global Positioning System (GPS) was used to
               co-localize the legged robot with respect to a Micro Aerial
               Vehicle (MAV) that creates maps from the aerial view. The high

               steps and stairs, with statically and dynamically stable gaits.
               Moreover, the versatile machine can adapt its posture for
               inspection and payload delivery. The paper concludes with insight

               navigate confined spaces due to their high degrees of freedom.
               However, this has not been exploited in most common multilegged
               platforms. This paper presents a deformable bounding box
               abstraction of the robot model, with accompanying mapping and
               planning strategies, that enable a legged robot to autonomously
               change its body shape to navigate confined spaces. The mapping
               is achieved using robot-centric multi-elevation maps generated
               with distance sensors carried by the robot. The path planning is
               based on the trajectory optimisation algorithm CHOMP which
               creates smooth trajectories while avoiding obstacles. The
               proposed method has been tested in simulation and implemented on
               the hexapod robot Weaver, which is 33 cm tall and 82 cm wide
