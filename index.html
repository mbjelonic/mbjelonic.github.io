  Traditional legged robots are capable of traversing challenging terrain,
  but lack of energy efficiency when compared to wheeled systems operating
  on flat environments. The combination of both locomotion domains overcomes
  the trade-off between mobility and efficiency. Therefore, we present a novel
  motion planner and controller which together enable a legged robot equipped
  with passive or powered wheels to perform hybrid locomotion, represented
  by an appropriate combination of driving and stepping maneuvers.
