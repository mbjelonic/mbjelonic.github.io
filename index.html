I am a PhD researcher at the <a href=http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/>Robotic Systems Lab of ETH Zurich</a> focusing on motion control and planning for wheeled-legged robots in rough terrain. The supervisors of my PhD are <a href=https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.html?persid=121911>Marco Hutter from ETH Zurich</a> and <a href=http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/SANGBAE@MIT.EDU>Sangbae Kim from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a>.

Traditional legged robots are capable of traversing challenging terrain,
but lack of energy efficiency when compared to wheeled systems operating
on flat environments. The combination of both locomotion domains overcomes
the trade-off between mobility and efficiency. Therefore, we present a novel
motion planner and controller which together enable a legged robot equipped
with passive or powered wheels to perform hybrid locomotion, represented
by an appropriate combination of driving and stepping maneuvers.
