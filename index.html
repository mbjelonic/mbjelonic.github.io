  I am known for developing the wheeled-legged robot ANYmal, which was part of my PhD at the <a href=http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/>Robotic Systems Lab of ETH Zurich</a>. The supervisors of my PhD are <a
    href=https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.html?persid=121911>Marco Hutter from ETH Zurich</a>,
    <a href=http://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html>Stelian Coros from ETH Zurich</a>, and <a
    href=http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/SANGBAE@MIT.EDU>Sangbae Kim from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  (MIT)</a>. As a postdoc, I continue my dream of bringing wheeled-legged robots to real-world applications. Stay tuned!

  The research community in legged robotics focuses on bio-inspired robots,
  although there are some human inventions that nature could not recreate.
  One of the most significant examples is the wheel that has made our
  transportation system more efficient and faster, especially in urban environments.
  Inspired by this human-made evolution, we developed the wheeled-legged robot
  ANYmal with non-steerable wheels attached to its legs, allowing the robot to
  be efficient on flat as well as agile on challenging terrain.

  This dissertation describes an optimization-based framework to perform
  complex and dynamic locomotion strategies for robots with legs and wheels.
  The proposed method allows to perform novel maneuvers, which exploit the
  wheeled-legged robot's full capabilities over challenging obstacles. By
  combining innovative techniques in motion control and planning, this work
  reveals the full potential of wheeled-legged robots and their superiority
  compared to their legged counterparts. This novel platform, with powered wheels,
  achieves a speed of 4 m/s on flat terrain, overcomes challenging obstacles
  with 1.5 m/s, and reduces the cost of transport by 83 % compared to
  legged systems. The work in this dissertation is published
  in two conference proceedings and three journal articles.
